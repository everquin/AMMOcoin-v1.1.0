# ❓ AMMOcoin Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to the most commonly asked questions about AMMOcoin. Find instant solutions and clarifications here.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What is AMMOcoin?
**AMMOcoin** is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on Proof of Stake consensus, featuring masternodes, governance voting, and staking rewards. It offers fast 3-minute block times and focuses on community-driven development.

### How do I get started with AMMOcoin?
1. **Download** the wallet from official sources
2. **Install** and sync with the network
3. **Encrypt** your wallet with a strong password
4. **Backup** your wallet.dat file securely
5. **Start staking** or consider running a masternode

### Where can I buy AMMOcoin?
- **Exchanges**: Check CoinMarketCap for current listings
- **DEX Trading**: Decentralized exchange pairs
- **OTC Trading**: Direct peer-to-peer trades
- **Mining/Staking**: Earn through network participation

### Is AMMOcoin safe to use?
Yes, when following security best practices:
- ✅ **Encrypt your wallet**
- ✅ **Backup regularly**
- ✅ **Keep software updated**
- ✅ **Use official sources only**
- ✅ **Never share private keys**

## 💰 Wallet Questions

### How do I backup my wallet?
```bash
# Method 1: Backup wallet.dat
ammocoin-cli backupwallet "backup_YYYYMMDD.dat"

# Method 2: Export private keys
ammocoin-cli dumpwallet "keys_backup.txt"

# Store backups in multiple secure locations
```

### I forgot my wallet password. Can it be recovered?
**❌ No.** Wallet passwords cannot be recovered by anyone, including the development team. This is by design for security. Your only option is to restore from a backup made before encryption.

### How do I restore my wallet?
```bash
# Stop wallet
ammocoin-cli stop

# Replace wallet file
cp your_backup.dat ~/.ammocoin/wallet.dat

# Restart and rescan
ammocoind -rescan
```

### Why is my balance showing as 0?
Common causes:
- **Wallet not synced** - Wait for full blockchain download
- **Wrong network** - Ensure you're on mainnet, not testnet
- **Corrupted wallet** - Restore from backup
- **Need rescan** - Run `ammocoind -rescan`

### How long does wallet sync take?
- **Initial sync**: 1-4 hours (depending on internet/hardware)
- **SSD vs HDD**: SSD is 3-5x faster
- **Daily sync**: 1-5 minutes if wallet was offline <24 hours

## 🎯 Staking Questions

### What is staking?
**Staking** is holding AMMO coins in your wallet to help secure the network and earn rewards. Your coins have a chance to create new blocks and earn block rewards.

### How much can I earn from staking?
- **Annual Return**: ~8-12% per year
- **Factors**: Your coin amount, network weight, uptime
- **Frequency**: Small amounts may stake weekly/monthly
- **Compounding**: Rewards automatically increase your staking weight

### What's the minimum amount needed for staking?
- **Technical minimum**: 1 AMMO
- **Practical minimum**: 100+ AMMO for regular rewards
- **Recommended**: 1,000+ AMMO for frequent rewards

### Why isn't my wallet staking?
Check these common issues:
```bash
# Verify staking is enabled
ammocoin-cli getstakinginfo

# Common problems:
# - Wallet locked (unlock for staking)
# - Coins too new (wait 8+ hours)
# - Network disconnected (check peers)
# - Insufficient mature coins
```

### How do I unlock my wallet for staking?
```bash
# Unlock for staking only (secure)
ammocoin-cli walletpassphrase "your_password" 999999 true

# The 'true' parameter means "staking only"
# 999999 = stay unlocked for ~11 days
```

### My coins aren't staking after days/weeks. Why?
- **Small amounts** may take weeks or months to stake
- **Network weight** affects frequency - more network stakes = longer waits
- **Coin age** resets when you stake, starting the wait over
- **Consider** combining small amounts or getting more AMMO

## 🏛️ Masternode Questions

### What is a masternode?
A **masternode** is a special type of node that provides enhanced services to the network (InstantSend, governance voting) and earns premium rewards in return for maintaining 100,000 AMMO collateral.

### How much does it cost to run a masternode?
- **Collateral**: Exactly 100,000 AMMO
- **VPS Costs**: $5-20/month for hosting
- **Setup Time**: 2-4 hours initial setup
- **Technical Knowledge**: Basic Linux command line skills

### What returns can I expect from a masternode?
- **Annual Returns**: ~15-25% per year
- **Monthly Rewards**: ~100-200 AMMO (varies with network size)
- **Payment Frequency**: Every 12-24 hours typically
- **Break-even**: ~2-3 years (excluding AMMO price appreciation)

### Can I run multiple masternodes?
**Yes!** Each requires:
- Separate 100,000 AMMO collateral
- Separate VPS/server
- Unique configuration
- Individual monitoring

### What happens if my masternode goes offline?
- **Short downtime** (<1 hour): Usually no penalty
- **Extended downtime**: Status changes to EXPIRED
- **Payment missed**: You lose that round's reward
- **Restart**: Can restart anytime, returns to queue

### Can I spend my masternode collateral?
**Yes**, but it will immediately disable your masternode. The 100,000 AMMO must remain untouched in your wallet for the masternode to stay active.

## 🌐 Network Questions

### What are AMMOcoin's key specifications?
| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Block Time** | 3 minutes |
| **Total Supply** | 9,999,999,999 AMMO |
| **Consensus** | Proof of Stake |
| **Masternode Collateral** | 100,000 AMMO |
| **Network Port** | 37020 |
| **RPC Port** | 37021 |

### How do I check if I'm on the correct network?
```bash
# Check network info
ammocoin-cli getnetworkinfo

# Verify chain
ammocoin-cli getblockchaininfo | grep chain
# Should show "main" not "test" or "regtest"

# Check protocol version
# Should be 70920 or higher
```

### What's the difference between mainnet and testnet?
- **Mainnet**: Real network with real AMMO coins
- **Testnet**: Test network for development, coins have no value
- **Configuration**: Add `testnet=1` to use testnet
- **Data**: Stored in separate directories

### How many peers should I have?
- **Minimum**: 3-8 peers for basic operation
- **Good**: 10-20 peers for stable operation
- **Optimal**: 20-50 peers for best performance
- **Too many**: 100+ may slow performance
