Comprehensive security guide to protect your AMMOcoin investments and maintain operational security. Follow these practices to keep your funds safe.

## 🎯 Security Fundamentals

### Core Security Principles
1. **🔐 Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **🔑 Principle of Least Privilege** - Minimum necessary access
3. **💾 Regular Backups** - Multiple secure copies
4. **🔄 Keep Updated** - Latest software versions
5. **🕵️ Stay Vigilant** - Monitor for suspicious activity

### Threat Landscape
Understanding common attack vectors:
- **💻 Malware & Keyloggers** - Steal passwords/private keys
- **🎣 Phishing** - Fake websites and emails
- **👤 Social Engineering** - Manipulation tactics
- **🔓 Weak Passwords** - Brute force attacks
- **📱 SIM Swapping** - Mobile account takeover
- **🌐 Man-in-the-Middle** - Network interception

## 🪙 Wallet Security

### Wallet Encryption
**Always encrypt your wallet immediately after creation:**

```bash
# Encrypt with strong password
ammocoin-cli encryptwallet "your_very_strong_password_123!"

# Wallet will restart automatically
# Test unlock immediately
ammocoin-cli walletpassphrase "your_very_strong_password_123!" 30
```

### Password Security
**Create strong, unique passwords:**

#### Password Requirements
- **Length**: Minimum 20 characters
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Uniqueness**: Different from all other passwords
- **Memorability**: Use passphrase method

#### Example Strong Password Creation
```
# Weak: password123
# Better: MyAMMOcoinWallet2024!
# Best: correct-horse-battery-staple-AMMO-2024-!@#
```

#### Password Management
- **Use password manager** (1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass)
- **Never store in plain text**
- **Don't share with anyone**
- **Write down on paper** for critical passwords (store securely)

### Backup Strategies

#### Multiple Backup Types
```bash
# 1. Wallet.dat file backup
ammocoin-cli backupwallet "wallet_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dat"

# 2. Private key export
ammocoin-cli dumpwallet "private_keys_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt"

# 3. Seed phrase backup (if supported)
# Write down and store physically
```

#### Backup Storage Locations
- **🏠 Home safe** - Fire-resistant, waterproof
- **🏦 Bank safe deposit box** - Most secure option
- **☁️ Encrypted cloud storage** - Use strong encryption
- **💾 Multiple USB drives** - Stored in different locations
- **📱 Mobile encrypted storage** - As additional backup

#### Backup Testing
```bash
# Regularly test backup restoration
# Use test wallet or testnet

# 1. Create test wallet
mkdir ~/test_restore && cd ~/test_restore

# 2. Restore from backup
cp ~/your_backup.dat ~/.ammocoin_test/wallet.dat

# 3. Start test instance
ammocoind -datadir=~/.ammocoin_test

# 4. Verify restoration worked
ammocoin-cli -datadir=~/.ammocoin_test getbalance
```

### Cold Storage Setup

#### What is Cold Storage?
**Cold storage** keeps private keys completely offline, away from internet threats.

#### Paper Wallet Creation
```bash
# Generate new address offline
ammocoin-cli getnewaddress "cold_storage"

# Export private key
ammocoin-cli dumpprivkey "cold_storage_address"

# Print both address and private key
# Store paper securely offline
```

#### Hardware Wallet Integration
- **Ledger**: Check for AMMOcoin support
- **Trezor**: Verify compatibility
- **KeepKey**: Confirm integration
- **Air-gapped computer**: Create offline signing setup

#### Cold Staking Setup
```bash
# Delegate staking rights to hot wallet
# Keep coins in cold storage
# Earn rewards while maintaining security

# Set up delegation (when available)
ammocoin-cli delegatestake "cold_address" "hot_staking_address"
```

## 🌐 Network Security

### Node Security Hardening

#### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian UFW
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH (change port for security)
sudo ufw allow 37020/tcp # AMMOcoin P2P
sudo ufw enable

# Don't open RPC port (37021) to internet
# Keep RPC local only
```

#### SSH Security (for VPS/remote nodes)
```bash
# 1. Change default SSH port
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Change: Port 22 -> Port 2222

# 2. Disable root login
# Set: PermitRootLogin no

# 3. Use key-based authentication
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 user@your_server

# 4. Disable password authentication
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no

# 5. Restart SSH
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

#### Fail2Ban Protection
```bash
# Install fail2ban
sudo apt install fail2ban

# Configure for SSH and AMMOcoin
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

```ini
[DEFAULT]
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600
maxretry = 3

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 2222
logpath = /var/log/auth.log

[ammocoin]
enabled = true
port = 37020
logpath = /home/user/.ammocoin/debug.log
```

### RPC Security

#### Secure RPC Configuration
```conf
# ammocoin.conf - Secure RPC setup
server=1
rpcuser=secure_random_username_$(openssl rand -hex 8)
rpcpassword=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Restrict RPC access
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1

# Use non-default port (optional)
rpcport=47021
```

#### RPC over SSH Tunnel
```bash
# Connect to remote node securely
ssh -L 37021:localhost:37021 user@remote_server

# Now use local RPC commands
ammocoin-cli -rpcport=37021 getinfo
```

### Tor Integration

#### Privacy with Tor
```conf
# ammocoin.conf - Tor configuration
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
listen=1
onion=127.0.0.1:9050
onlynet=onion
addnode=xf7fxxxx.onion:37020

# Disable IPv4/IPv6 if only using Tor
discover=0
dns=0
```

#### Setting up Tor
```bash
# Install Tor
sudo apt install tor

# Configure Tor
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
# Add: HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ammocoin/
# Add: HiddenServicePort 37020 127.0.0.1:37020

# Start Tor
sudo systemctl start tor

# Get your onion address
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/ammocoin/hostname
```

## 🏛️ Masternode Security

### Masternode Security Architecture
- **🔑 Control wallet** - Holds collateral, stays offline
- **🖥️ Remote server** - Runs masternode, no private keys
- **🔒 Separation** - Never store 100k AMMO on VPS

### VPS Security Hardening

#### Initial Server Setup
```bash
# 1. Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# 2. Create non-root user
adduser ammocoin
usermod -aG sudo ammocoin

# 3. Configure SSH keys
mkdir /home/ammocoin/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/ammocoin/.ssh

# 4. Disable root login
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PermitRootLogin no
```

#### Security Monitoring
```bash
# Install monitoring tools
sudo apt install htop iotop nethogs fail2ban

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Monitor network connections
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep ammocoin

# Check for unauthorized access
sudo last
sudo grep -i "failed\|error" /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Automated Security Updates
```bash
# Enable automatic security updates
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades

# Configure automatic updates
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades

# Check update status
sudo systemctl status unattended-upgrades
```

### Masternode Key Management

#### Secure Key Generation
```bash
# Generate masternode private key offline
ammocoin-cli masternode genkey

# Store securely - this key goes on VPS
# Original wallet stays offline with collateral
```

#### Key Storage Best Practices
- **🔐 Encrypt** private keys at rest
- **🚫 Never email** private keys
- **📝 Document** key locations securely
- **🔄 Regular rotation** if compromised

## 🕵️ Operational Security

### Daily Security Practices

#### Regular Security Checks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# security_check.sh - Daily security audit

echo "=== AMMOcoin Security Check ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"

# Check wallet encryption
ENCRYPTED=$(ammocoin-cli getwalletinfo | jq -r .unlocked_until)
if [ "$ENCRYPTED" != "null" ]; then
    echo "✅ Wallet encrypted"
else
    echo "❌ WARNING: Wallet not encrypted!"
fi

# Check peer connections
PEERS=$(ammocoin-cli getconnectioncount)
if [ "$PEERS" -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "✅ Good peer connections: $PEERS"
else
    echo "⚠️ Low peer count: $PEERS"
fi

# Check for suspicious log entries
ERRORS=$(grep -c -i "error\|fail\|attack" ~/.ammocoin/debug.log)
if [ "$ERRORS" -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "✅ Log looks clean: $ERRORS errors"
else
    echo "⚠️ Many errors in log: $ERRORS"
fi

echo "Security check complete."
```

#### Transaction Verification
```bash
# Always verify transaction details before sending
ammocoin-cli sendtoaddress "address" amount

# Double-check:
# 1. Recipient address is correct
# 2. Amount is correct (watch decimal places)
# 3. Network fee is reasonable
# 4. You have sufficient funds
```

### Phishing Protection

#### Common Phishing Tactics
- **📧 Fake emails** - Claiming wallet issues
- **🌐 Fake websites** - Mimicking official sites
- **📱 Fake apps** - Malicious wallet applications
- **💬 Social media scams** - Impersonation accounts

#### Protection Strategies
- **✅ Bookmark** official websites
- **✅ Verify URLs** carefully (check SSL certificates)
- **✅ Download** only from official sources
- **✅ Enable 2FA** where available
- **❌ Never** enter passwords from email links

### Social Engineering Defense

#### Common Social Engineering Attacks
- **🎭 Impersonation** - Fake support staff
- **😱 Urgency tactics** - "Act now or lose funds"
- **🎁 Too good to be true** - Guaranteed returns
- **❓ Information gathering** - "Help us verify your account"

#### Defense Strategies
- **🤔 Stay skeptical** - Verify requests independently
- **⏰ Take time** - Don't rush financial decisions
- **📞 Verify identity** - Call back on known numbers
- **🚫 Never share** - Private keys, passwords, seeds

## 🛡️ Advanced Security

### Multi-Signature Wallets

#### What is Multi-Sig?
**Multi-signature** requires multiple private keys to authorize transactions, adding security layers.

```bash
# Create 2-of-3 multisig address
ammocoin-cli createmultisig 2 '["pubkey1","pubkey2","pubkey3"]'

# Add to wallet
ammocoin-cli addmultisigaddress 2 '["address1","address2","address3"]'

# Requires 2 signatures to spend
```

#### Use Cases for Multi-Sig
- **🏢 Business funds** - Require multiple officers
- **💑 Joint accounts** - Both partners must approve
- **🏦 Escrow services** - Neutral third party
- **🔒 High-value storage** - Enhanced security

### Air-Gapped Signing

#### Offline Transaction Signing
```bash
# 1. Create unsigned transaction (online computer)
ammocoin-cli createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"...","vout":0}]' '{"address":amount}'

# 2. Transfer hex to offline computer (USB/QR code)

# 3. Sign transaction (offline computer)
ammocoin-cli signrawtransaction "unsigned_hex"

# 4. Transfer signed hex back to online computer

# 5. Broadcast transaction (online computer)
ammocoin-cli sendrawtransaction "signed_hex"
```

### Hardware Security Modules (HSM)

#### Professional HSM Options
- **🏢 Enterprise HSMs** - For exchanges and businesses
- **☁️ Cloud HSMs** - AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM
- **💾 USB HSMs** - YubiKey, SoftHSM
- **🏠 DIY HSMs** - Raspberry Pi + secure storage
