# AMMOcoin Whitepaper v1.1.0

**A Privacy-Focused, Community-Driven Cryptocurrency Platform**

---

## Abstract

AMMOcoin (AMMO) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin and PIVX codebase, designed to provide enhanced financial privacy, community governance, and sustainable economics through Proof-of-Stake consensus. Version 1.1.0 introduces significant improvements including Sapling privacy transactions, enhanced staking mechanisms, and comprehensive masternode functionality.

## 1. Introduction

AMMOcoin represents a significant evolution in privacy-focused cryptocurrency technology. Built upon the proven foundation of PIVX, which itself extends Bitcoin's robust architecture, AMMOcoin delivers advanced privacy features, energy-efficient consensus mechanisms, and community-driven governance.

### 1.1 Project Goals

- **Privacy by Default**: Implement cutting-edge privacy technologies including zk-SNARKs
- **Community Governance**: Enable decentralized decision-making through masternode voting
- **Sustainable Economics**: Utilize Proof-of-Stake for energy efficiency and fair distribution
- **Technical Excellence**: Maintain highest standards of code quality and security

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Core Technology Stack

AMMOcoin v1.1.0 implements several advanced technologies:

- **Base Protocol**: Bitcoin Core with PIVX enhancements
- **Consensus**: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with masternode network
- **Privacy**: Sapling zk-SNARK protocol for shielded transactions
- **Governance**: Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) features
- **Network**: P2P networking with advanced peer discovery

### 2.2 Sapling Privacy Technology

Version 1.1.0 introduces full Sapling support, providing:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Complete transaction privacy without revealing amounts or addresses
- **Selective Disclosure**: Optional transaction transparency for compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized proof generation and verification
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with transparent transactions

### 2.3 Consensus Mechanism

AMMOcoin utilizes Proof-of-Stake consensus with the following parameters:

- **Block Time**: 60 seconds
- **Stake Maturity**: 600 confirmations (~10 hours)
- **Minimum Stake**: No minimum required
- **Annual Staking Rewards**: Variable based on network participation

### 2.4 Masternode Network

The masternode network provides:

- **Instant Transactions**: Near-instantaneous transaction confirmation
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Additional mixing and obfuscation layers
- **Network Governance**: Voting rights on network proposals
- **Collateral Requirement**: 10,000 AMMO per masternode

## 3. Privacy Features

### 3.1 Transaction Types

AMMOcoin supports multiple transaction types:

1. **Transparent Transactions**: Standard Bitcoin-style transactions
2. **Shielded Transactions**: Fully private using Sapling protocol
3. **Mixed Transactions**: Combining transparent and shielded outputs

### 3.2 Address Types

- **Transparent Addresses**: Standard UTXO model addresses
- **Shielded Addresses**: zk-SNARK protected addresses starting with 'zs'
- **Viewing Keys**: Optional keys for selective transaction disclosure

## 4. Economic Model

### 4.1 Supply Schedule

- **Total Supply**: Dynamic supply with controlled inflation
- **Block Rewards**: Distributed between stakers (80%) and masternodes (20%)
- **Governance**: 5% of block rewards allocated to treasury proposals

### 4.2 Staking Economics

Version 1.1.0 implements improved staking mechanisms:

- **Compound Staking**: Automatic restaking of rewards
- **Cold Staking**: Stake from offline wallets via delegation
- **Flexible Staking**: No lock-up periods, stake/unstake anytime

## 5. Governance

### 5.1 Decentralized Governance

AMMOcoin implements on-chain governance through:

- **Proposal System**: Community can submit funding proposals
- **Masternode Voting**: Network consensus on proposals
- **Treasury Funding**: Automatic funding of approved proposals
- **Budget Cycles**: Monthly voting and funding cycles

### 5.2 Community Participation

- **Voting Rights**: Masternode operators vote on network decisions
- **Proposal Creation**: Anyone can submit proposals with minimal fee
- **Transparent Process**: All votes and proposals recorded on blockchain

## 6. Security

### 6.1 Cryptographic Security

- **SHA-256**: Proven hash algorithm for transaction integrity
- **Secp256k1**: Elliptic curve cryptography for key generation
- **zk-SNARKs**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy preservation
- **BLS Signatures**: Advanced signature aggregation (planned enhancement)

### 6.2 Network Security

- **Proof-of-Stake**: Energy-efficient consensus with economic finality
- **Masternode Network**: Additional security layer with collateral requirements
- **Checkpointing**: Historical block validation for long-range attack prevention
